    "In order to establish a well-defined DiD regression we need to consider and comply for its assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly: Considering Barcelona as the main tourist hub for Spain during the summer season, the choice for another city would be initially narrowed down to cities in Spain that are also highly visited during these times. Along with keeping this in check, it would be wise to consider locations with similarities in what the city has to offer in the cultural and general entertainment scene; as well as population and extension factors. It is also important to denote that Barcelona is a coastal city, and thus we would also have to compare to a coastal city; or add a beach proximity control if choosing a landlocked sister location. \n",
    "\n",
    "The logical choice for a city that fulfills most of these conditions to match with Barcelona is Madrid (making up the 2 largest cities in Spain by most measures). Population-wise, the metropolitan areas have the closest numbers to each other; in terms of economic and cultural activities they are also the most comparable and concurred during peak seasons. Although Madrid is in the middle on the Spanish territory, inputting a control for coastal proximity would allow us to isolate for the effect we are looking for; i.e.: it makes a better sense to compare Barcelona and Madrid than Barcelona and Valencia, or even that with cities outside of Spain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly: The time periods to consider would be a comparable week (to consider as the \"control\" time period) and an event week. Ideally, the comparable week and the event week should have close similiraties in terms of seasonality, weather, and specially that they are close in time (as well as factors pertaining to other yearly events that might increase affluence to the city). Another thing to keep in mind is the scale of the affluency event. Given the cultural differences between regions, we have to consider between choosing an event that would attract differentc types of tourists. Corporate, topic-specific events from the likes of the Mobile World Congress may have less attendance figures than cultural celebrations such as La Mercé; or than music-central activities such as the Primavera Sound Festival.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering all of this, by attendance information of the past iterations of events mentioned, our pick is for the Primavera Sound 2023 (May 31st - June 4th). Out of past versions of events mentioned, it had the highest participation for last year, around ~450.000 estimated attendees."

    "Differences-in-Differences approaches to causal inference require the assumptions of common trend and counterfactual trend for treated individuals (in the absence of treatment). The former property enables the underlying pattern of change that affects both cities, accounting for external factors. For the latter assumption, a counterfactual is requisite to draw comparisons of our target variable when the treatment (event) occurs for the group (city) we have decided to analyze. This in regard to a __comparable city__ where the event had not taken place.  Note that it is important for the correct set-up of a DiD (Differences-in-Differences) model that both subjects are comparable in underlying trends and characteristics; particularly those affecting economic and tourism patterns, which is why the best choice for Madrid would indeed be confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a DiD estimator to correctly hold and for estimations to be arguably significant we would first have to account for underlying characteristics and trends that may be proxied by data we also pull. Controls such as seasonality (a dummy for high or low season), economic conditions (income, consumer spending, unemployment rate, inflation), weather controls (average temperature, precipitation), and (given what was mentioned in the last exercise) a beach (dummy) and event location proximity (given that we have hotel name and could use lat and long coordinates) variable. These added variables are relevant in the sense that they isolate the effect we would be trying to estimate, which is the effect of the set event in Barcelona on accomoddation prices; reducing omitted variable bias.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- The use of text scraped from accommodation descriptions can be useful to denote price mark-ups in accordance to the ammenities that each accommodation has (think of high-speed internet, in-unit washing area, 24/7 surveillance, clerk availability, pool, gym). Hotel/apartment-quality/appeareance/architecture (i.e.: beautiful modern room, contemporary, loft-style) related adjectives may also be scraped to further differentiate between observations for more variability. It would be also important to consider through text scraping the unit descriptions if price premiums have a differential trend for different accommodation types; that is, varying estimators for hotel rooms, apartments, shared rooms, hostels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intentional price changes from accommodation handlers are part of the estimation set out by the model, the presence of an event is surely a driver of price mark-ups around the time of the event. As discussed before, the presence of a comparison group similar in economic and demographic characteristics is imperative for the estimation. To overcome composition of places changing we can make use of data coming from rating pages, size of accommodation, budget-orientation, and type. Furthermore, making use of panel data to account for time-invariant differences between locations would get control over the second issue."
