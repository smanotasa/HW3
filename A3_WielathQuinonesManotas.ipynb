    "\n",
    "To establish a well-defined DiD regression, we need to consider and comply with its assumptions. Mainly, we need to find a city with similar trends in accommodation prices. \n",
    "As Barcelona is the main tourist hub in Spain during the summer, the choice for another city would be initially narrowed down to cities in Spain that are also highly visited during this season. Along with keeping this in check, it would be wise to consider locations with similarities in what the city offers in the cultural and general entertainment scene, as well as population and extension factors. It is also important to denote that Barcelona is a coastal city, and thus we would also have to compare it to a coastal city. If we included multiple cities, some of which are at the coast, we could add a beach proximity control.\n",
    "Madrid is the city that fulfills most of these conditions to match Barcelona (except for the coast proximity). Population-wise, the metropolitan areas have the closest numbers to each other; in terms of economic and cultural activities, they are also the most comparable and concurred during peak seasons. Although Madrid is in the middle of the Spanish territory, we expect that accommodation services in Barcelona are more similar to those in Madrid than, for example, those in Valencia, or even cities outside of Spain. Therefore, we think that Madrid is the best choice for a city showing similar trends in accommodation prices, which is why we include it in our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to keep in mind is the scale of the event. Corporate, topic-specific events like the Mobile World Congress may have lower attendance than cultural celebrations such as La Mercé or music-central activities such as the Primavera Sound Festival.\n",
    "Out of the events mentioned, the Primavera Sound had the highest participation in the past, with around 450.000 estimated attendees. We, therefore, decided to take the Primavera Sound 2023 (May 31st - June 4th) as the event to observe. \n",
    "For the comparison, finding a period over which we expect stable trends in accommodation prices is crucial. Ideally, the week without the event and the event week should have close similarities in seasonality and weather, and one should directly follow the other. \n",
    "The second period we include is from May 24th to May 28th, the days before the festival happens in Barcelona. We are keeping the slots close to allow for similar weather and seasonality characteristics. We decided to use this week rather than the week after the festival. That is because the Primavera Sound 2023 will be installed in Madrid from June 7th to June 11th, which might infer our analysis and lead to biased estimators. \n",

    "$ Accommodation Price_{it} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\cdot City_i + \\beta_{2} \\cdot t + \\beta_{3} \\cdot t \\cdot City_i + \\epsilon_ {it} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $i$ is the index for accommodations included in our study and t a binary variable with zero for the period before the event and one for the period of the event. $City_i$ is a dummy variable indicating whether accommodation $i$ is placed in Barcelona or in Madrid with one and zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "This equation however, does not include any controls, which may present omitted variable bias when running it like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of the Differences-in-Differences approach is to identify a causal effect of the event on the prices of rental bookings. The best way to identify a causal relationship would be to observe two states of the same city simultaneously. One where the event is happening and one where it never happened. Unfortunately, this is not possible. Once the event occurs, we never know what would have happened to the booking prices if the event had not occurred. We have no counterfactual. \n",
    "To estimate the causal effect, we can not just compare the same city before and after the event because other things might have changed over the same period, making the comparison invalid. For example, if Barcelona experiences a general decrease in tourism, a pre-post analysis might lead to downward biased estimators. We can also not just compare the booking prices during the event in one city to booking prices in another city. The two cities might have different characteristics. Maybe the booking prices in the cities have been different ever since. \n",
    "The DiD approach identifies a causal effect by combining the previously described methods, thereby eliminating their shortcomings. \n",
    "In this approach, we include another city and another time period in our study. Ensuring that both cities show similar trends constitutes the main building block of Differences-in-Differences analysis, the parallel trend assumption. It requires that the change between both periods would have been of similar magnitude for both cities in the absence of the treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "It might be that the distribution of apartments in one city has characteristics that differ from the one in the other city. We, therefore, include control variables in our regression. Doing so allows us to ensure that even if ,for some reason, we dont have parallel trends in the first place, we can control for these reasons and establish parallel trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more likely that both places show parallel trends, we select a city with comparable characteristics, particularly those affecting economic and tourism patterns. This is why we decided to include Madrid in our study. As previously noted, the equation in its simplest form above did not include control variables. This might be a problem because it could be that we do not have clear parallel trends between the rental prices in Barcelona and Madrid. After all, the characteristics of the apartments in both cities can be different; we have to control for them. For example, it could be that in Barcelona, there are more high-end apartments than in Madrid. Since the prices of high-end apartments might change differently over time, we should include a control for high-end apartments in our equation. Maybe other characteristics of the distribution of rental apartments in Barcelona and Madrid are also different. For example, in Barcelona, there might be more apartments on lower floor numbers, while in Madrid more on higher floor numbers. Including a control for the floor number of an apartment might also be helpful. Or other things, such as the number of square meters an apartment has. Taking these individual-level characteristics into account would ensure the validity of our estimates is maintained.\n",
    "Note that in a scenario where we include data from more than just two cities, we could also control for specific city-level characteristics, such as whether a place is a coastal city or not. In the case of Madrid and Barcelona, such a variable would only be the same as the City indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Accommodation Price_{it} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\cdot City_i + \\beta_{2} \\cdot t + \\beta_{3} \\cdot t \\cdot City_i + \\sum_{j=1}^k \\beta_{3+j} \\cdot \\gamma_{jit} + \\epsilon_ {it} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, breaking down this equation by terms, coefficients would be interpreted in this way; our outcome variable being hotel price:\n",
    "- $\\beta_{0}$ as the intercept.\n",
    "- $\\beta_{1}$ considering City would assume 1 if Barcelona, 0 if else. It measures the baseline differences between groups before the intervetion.\n",
    "- $\\beta_{2}$ would aim to measure the effect of the time period for the control group (Madrid). Event Week takes the value of 1 for May 31st - June 4th; 0 if else. It reflects the expected mean change in outcome between \"eras\".\n",
    "- $\\beta_{3}$ the coefficient for the interaction term of the prior regressors would capture the difference in changes between treated and control groups. It estimates the differences in y from before to after in between the groups. The hallmark estimator, DiD.\n",
    "- $\\beta_{3+j}$ will approximate the effect of the controls we set in order to better isolate our DiD coefficients, these may go either negative or positive ways depending on our information; ceteris paribus.\n",

    "- The use of text scraped from accommodation descriptions can be useful to denote price mark-ups in accordance to the ammenities that each accommodation has (think of high-speed internet, in-unit washing area, 24/7 surveillance, clerk availability, pool, gym). Hotel/apartment-quality/appeareance/architecture (i.e.: beautiful modern room, contemporary, loft-style) related adjectives may also be scraped to further differentiate between observations for more variability. It would be also important to consider through text scraping the unit descriptions if price premiums have a differential trend for different accommodation types; that is, varying estimators for hotel rooms, apartments, shared rooms, hostels. We can also make use of lat and long coordinates to instantiate an event proximity variable. This would be scraped from the general area description, or by looking up the coordinates given addresses found in the webpage.\n",

    "- By breaking down the price of a good or service into its numerous components or attributes a hedonic approach would seek to evaluate the value that consumers place on various hotel attributes, such as room size, location, facilities, and other ammenities. This would essentially assist in determining the impact of changes in a certain characteristic on the overall price of a hotel by breaking the price down into its component pieces. This makes it possible to determine how changes in a specific characteristic (such the availability of a specific facility) affect the overall pricing of a hotel, which is helpful for the aforementioned consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whilst our timeframes for analysis are closely matched, there still may be the case where one of the two periods has higher (or lower) supply-side actors (accommodations) that should be separated for a clearer DiD estimator. Hence, it is important to realize the difference between each hotel's impact on price compared to those around them. It may be the case where the presence of the festival affects various types of accommodations in a non-identical way; prices for hostels will not experience the same exact trends as 5-star luxury hotels. We consider this could be tackled in ways such as considering a market-share control (if the information is available), or by breaking down our samples into categories for the many identifiable accommodation types  to isolate the extensive margin consideration for each category. This would ideally approximate how changes in multiple market segments from the supply-side affect overall booking prices. This in-sample comparison would give a clearer picture on how the festival as a role on determining prices within each group, while at the same time controlling for structural differences from out-of-group inference. An empirical approach to the latter may be done with a DDD (triple difference) estimator; keeping the original estimator, a second step for a DiD in between room/apartment categories can help the extensive margins consideration (note that a DDD estimator is achieved by the difference of two DiD).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intentional price changes from accommodation handlers are part of the estimation set out by the model. The presence of an event is surely a driver of price mark-ups around the time of the event. As discussed before, a comparison group similar in economic and demographic characteristics is imperative for the estimation. To estimate the effect of the event on the price changes by the same rental places, we only include places in our analysis for which we have two time periods of pricing data. We ensure that the changes are not due to locations entering and leaving the market but to changes in the price for listings already on the market. As a comparison, we could run a city-level analysis, in which we compare the change in the mean price of all listings over time. If price changes of individual accommodations cause the mean price changes, then the two estimates should be the same. If the two estimates are not the equal, we know that changes in the market composition must be accountable for this difference."
